I was tasked with analyzing the data provided to me by SyriaTel in relation to customers leaving their service. In doing so, I determined that the most important questions to answer were:

What is the Baseline Churn Rate?
Which features contribute to churn?
Which features have the biggest impact on churn?
What can be done to identify when a customer is at risk for churn?
What can be done to prevent churn?
